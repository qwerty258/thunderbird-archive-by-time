# Motivation

With the filter function comes with thunderbird, all emails met rules will be moved to a specific folder. As time passed the folder would grew bigger and I wanted to put all emails into sub folders classified by year.

# Example

With filter rules all emails come from thunderbird.net were moved to `Thunderbird` under local folder.

```
Local Folder
    |-Thunderbird
    |-Mozilla
```

I wanted to make sub folders by year and move emails to corresponding year.

```
Local Folder
    |-Thunderbird
    |   |-Thunderbird.2022
    |   |-Thunderbird.2023
    |-Mozilla
```

Move emails into folders by year as first step. Folders by month is possible.
